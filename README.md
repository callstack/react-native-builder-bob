## Documentation

Documentation is available at [https://callstack.github.io/react-native-builder-bob/](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-builder-bob/).

## Development workflow

This project uses a monorepo using `yarn`. To setup the project, run `yarn` in the root directory to install the required dependencies.

```sh
yarn
```

While developing, you can run watch mode to automatically rebuild the changes:

```sh
yarn watch
```

To test the CLI locally, you can point to the appropriate executable:

```sh
../bob/packages/create-react-native-library/bin/create-react-native-library
```

Before sending a pull request, make sure your code passes TypeScript and ESLint. Run the following to verify:

```sh
yarn typecheck
yarn lint
```

To fix formatting errors, run the following:

```sh
yarn lint --fix
```

The documentation for the project is under `docs` directory. To run the documentation locally, run the following:

```sh
yarn docs dev
```

## Publishing

Maintainers with write access to the GitHub repo and the npm organization can publish new versions. To publish a new version, first, you need to export a `GH_TOKEN` environment variable as mentioned [here](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/blob/main/packages/version/README.md#remote-client-auth-tokens). Then run:

```sh
yarn lerna publish
```

This will automatically bump the version and publish the packages. It'll also publish the changelogs on GitHub for each package.

When releasing a pre-release version, we need to:

- Update `lerna.json` to set the `preId` (e.g. `next`) and `preDistTag` (e.g. `next`) fields, and potentially the `allowBranch` field.
- Run the following command:

```sh
yarn lerna publish --conventional-commits --conventional-prerelease --preid next
```

When releasing a stable version, we need to:

- Remove the `preId` and `preDistTag` fields from `lerna.json`.
- Run the following command:

```sh
yarn lerna publish --conventional-commits --conventional-graduate
```
