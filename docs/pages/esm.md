# ESM support

Libraries created with [`create-react-native-library`](./create.md) are pre-configured to work with ESM (ECMAScript Modules) out of the box.

You can verify whether ESM support is enabled by checking the configuration for [`react-native-builder-bob`](./build.md) in the `package.json` file of the library:

```json
"react-native-builder-bob": {
  "source": "src",
  "output": "lib",
  "targets": [
    ["commonjs", { "esm": true }],
    ["module", { "esm": true }],
    "typescript"
  ]
}
```

The `"esm": true` option enables ESM-compatible output by adding the `.js` extension to the import statements in the generated files. For TypeScript, it also generates 2 sets of type definitions: one for the CommonJS build and one for the ES module build.

It's recommended to specify `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` and `"resolvePackageJsonImports": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file to match [Metro's behavior](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2023/06/21/package-exports-support#enabling-package-exports-beta):

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "resolvePackageJsonImports": false
  }
}
```

Specifying `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` means that you don't need to use file extensions in the import statements. Bob automatically adds them when possible during the build process.

To make use of the output files, ensure that your `package.json` file contains the following fields:

```json
"main": "./lib/commonjs/index.js",
"module": "./lib/module/index.js",
"types": "./lib/typescript/commonjs/src/index.d.ts",
"exports": {
  ".": {
    "import": {
      "types": "./lib/typescript/module/src/index.d.ts",
      "default": "./lib/module/index.js"
    },
    "require": {
      "types": "./lib/typescript/commonjs/src/index.d.ts",
      "default": "./lib/commonjs/index.js"
    }
  }
},
```

The `main`, `module` and `types` fields are for legacy setups that don't support the `exports` field. See the [Manual configuration](build.md#manual-configuration) guide for more information about those fields.

The `exports` field is used by modern tools and bundlers to determine the correct entry point. Here, we specify 2 conditions:

- `import`: Used when the library is imported with an `import` statement or a dynamic `import()`. It should point to the ESM build.
- `require`: Used when the library is required with a `require` call. It should point to the CommonJS build.

Each condition has a `types` field - necessary for TypeScript to provide the appropriate definitions for the module system. The type definitions have slightly different semantics for CommonJS and ESM, so it's important to specify them separately.

The `default` field is the fallback entry point for both conditions. It's used for the actual JS code when the library is imported or required.

You can also specify additional conditions for different scenarios, such as `react-native`, `browser`, `production`, `development` etc. Note that support for these conditions depends on the tooling you're using.

## Guidelines

There are still a few things to keep in mind if you want your library to be ESM-compatible:

- Avoid using default exports in your library. Named exports are recommended. Default exports produce a CommonJS module with a `default` property, which will work differently than the ESM build and can cause issues.
- If the library uses platform-specific extensions (e.g., `.ios.js` or `.android.js`), the ESM output will not be compatible with Node.js, i.e. it's not possible to use the library in Node.js with `import` syntax. It's necessary to omit file extensions from the imports to make platform-specific extensions work, however, Node.js requires file extensions to be present.

  Bundlers such as Metro can handle this without additional configuration. Other bundlers may need to be configured to make extensionless imports to work, (e.g. it's necessary to specify [`resolve.fullySpecified: false`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#resolvefullyspecified) for Webpack).

  It's still possible to use the library in Node.js using the CommonJS build with `require`:

  ```js
  const { foo } = require('my-library');
  ```

- Avoid using `.cjs`, `.mjs`, `.cts` or `.mts` extensions. Metro always requires file extensions in import statements when using `.cjs` or `.mjs` which breaks platform-specific extension resolution.
- Avoid using `"moduleResolution": "node16"` or `"moduleResolution": "nodenext"` in your `tsconfig.json` file. They require file extensions in import statements which breaks platform-specific extension resolution.
- If you specify a `react-native` condition in `exports`, make sure that it comes before `import` or `require`. The conditions should be ordered from the most specific to the least specific:

  ```json
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": {
        "types": "./lib/typescript/module/src/index.d.ts",
        "react-native": "./lib/modules/index.native.js",
        "default": "./lib/module/index.js"
      },
      "require": {
        "types": "./lib/typescript/commonjs/src/index.d.ts",
        "react-native": "./lib/commonjs/index.native.js",
        "default": "./lib/commonjs/index.js"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
